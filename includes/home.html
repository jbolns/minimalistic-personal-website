  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <h2>A super-light <span class="purple">minimalistic</span> website demo.</h2>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <p>This is a demo to demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JS skills. Coded from scratch. Very light: full thing stands at ~1MB. </p>
    <p>The goal is a personal website with super-minimal server impact â€“ a little about speed and a lot about the environment. By the same token, however, it's probably not the most user-friendly website.</p>
    <h2>Itemised description and pending tasks:</h2>
