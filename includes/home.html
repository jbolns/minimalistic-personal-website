  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <h2>A <span class="purple">super-light</span> and minimalist personal website demo.</h2>

<main>
  <section>
    <p>This is a demo to demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JS skills. Coded from scratch. Very light: full thing stands at ~1MB. </p>
    <p>The goal is a personal website with super-minimal server impact â€“ a little about speed and a lot about the environment. By the same token, however, it's probably not the most user-friendly website.</p>
    <h2>Itemised description and pending tasks:</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>HTML</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Full HTML5 sematics.</li>
        <li>Validation: W3C validator, no errors.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>CSS</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsive and well-styled minimalist site.</li>
        <li>Accessibility validation: Wave, no errors.</li>
        <li>PENDING: I want to add a few additional CSS templates (zen garden like) but this is low in the list of priorities.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>JS</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Collapsable menus on smaller screens.</li>
        <li>Single-load wireframe via jQuery 'loads' (or "includes", whatever floats your boat): unless the site is manually refreshed, the header, sidebar, and footer only load once.</li>
        <li>Vertical centering on load and reload</li>
        <li>Reload-friendly sections (it will always reload to the section you're currently viewing).</li>
      </ul>
