# minimalistic-personal-website
This is a demo to demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JS skills. The goal is an appropriately minimalistic personal website with a super-minimal server impact (a little about speed and a lot about the environment). 

+++ Highlights.
- Coded from scratch. 
- Very light: full thing stands at ~1MB.
- HTML5 sematics (Validation via W3C - no errors).
- Fully responsive (including vertical centering).
- Fully accessible (Validation via Wave - no errors).
- Fake "includes" via via jQuery 'loads' (unless manually refreshed, the header, sidebar, and footer only load once - further economising server).
